# Shaverma
## What is this project?
I wrote this project for my lecture at Yandex. The fact is that Yandex invited me to conduct a master class on writing chatbots and just talk about myself and my life as one of their best graduates. This bot is looking for the nearest/best shaverma. All the data was obtained by analyzing the reviews, and after that I ran all the data into a neural network, and it made funny reviews that were generated depending on the average level of the institution.
## What was the implementation?
the meaning was simple, we took and offered the user to share the geographical location, but since there was little time, I decided to conduct an analysis only depending on my city. And he showed the guys how to write menus, like in real store bots in telegram.
## What is in this vault?
This repository contains the code of this bot. To run it, you need to take your token and change it in the file config.py, then launch the bot, this is done by the command
```py
python proba.py
```
